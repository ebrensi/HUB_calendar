Dear Hub Oakland,
I am writing from the Art of Living Foundation, and would like to know if you would like to partner with us to celebrate the International Day of Happiness. The United Nations deemed March 20th the International Day of Happiness. See below for our plans. If we were to partner with you, we would love to have it at the HUB Impact Oakland, and invite your community. 
Happiness Gathering for International Day of Happiness
Thursday, March 20, 2014
7:00 PM to 8:30 PM
Berkeley Happiness Center
2424 Spaulding Ave, Berkeley, CA
The United Nations has named March 20th the International Day of Happiness.  What does it take for you to be happy? Come share and reflect.
The Art of Living Foundation, founder of ""The Happiness Program,"" celebrates with a Happiness Gathering. 
Breath, meditate, and celebrate. Be free, be light, now! Learn simple tools and techniques to rid the mind of stress and be Happy! 35 years ago Sri Sri Ravi Shankar started teaching people the Sudarshan Kriya- a purifying breathing technique. Since then millions around the world have learned it.  Dubbed the fastest growing spiritual movement on earth, we will be hosting our very own Happiness Program in Berkeley, April 17-21.

It looks like we're going to need a projector, and ""U-shaped or classroom style or at small tables/pods"". I think that as long as we have the tables and chairs in the room, we can set it up as the trainer sees fit.

 	I share an office space at the Hub now but am needing to do a presentation for a group I work with so looking for something with a screen that would enable me to do this and wondering about what technology support (like is there a way to plug in and present?) is available. Thank you. Blessings, Marianne",Downtown,Conference Room,DOWNTOWN,

All you have to do is relax in a specially designed chair, and a professional massage practitioner will take the kinks out of your back, shoulders, neck, head and arms.

Choose up to 30 minutes or more for the ultimate drop-in relaxation break.

Join us for an interactive presentation and tasty samples to see how delicious, nutritious, simple, and inexpensive veg eating can be! We will show you why and how to get more plant-based, whole food ingredients into your daily routine (or maybe just your Meatless Mondays) and debunk some myths along the way. Get practical tips, get inspired, and get ready to make a difference with every meal! 
Presented by Michelle Dwyer, Health Coach and Nutrition Consultant, and Lora Silver, Integrative Nutrition Health Coach. A short introduction to Meatless Monday will be presented by Kristie Middleton of The Humane Society of the United States. This event is part of Oakland Veg Week, an annual city-wide vegetarian pledge week that highlights the benefits of vegetarian eating and features workshops, film screenings, panel discussions, and the first annual Oakland Veg Fest.
