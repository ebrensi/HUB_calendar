Join us for an interactive presentation and tasty samples to see how delicious, nutritious, simple, and inexpensive veg eating can be! We will show you why and how to get more plant-based, whole food ingredients into your daily routine (or maybe just your Meatless Mondays) and debunk some myths along the way. Get practical tips, get inspired, and get ready to make a difference with every meal! 
Presented by Michelle Dwyer, Health Coach and Nutrition Consultant, and Lora Silver, Integrative Nutrition Health Coach. A short introduction to Meatless Monday will be presented by Kristie Middleton of The Humane Society of the United States. This event is part of Oakland Veg Week, an annual city-wide vegetarian pledge week that highlights the benefits of vegetarian eating and features workshops, film screenings, panel discussions, and the first annual Oakland Veg Fest.

Calgary--Hiya. 
Would it be possible to book the Meridian conference room next Thursday from 6-8 PM?
We'd like to bring a group in who will be Hack the Hood mentors, about 15 people.
Ideal set up would be a U of tables, with a projector set up toward one wall.
If this is possible, please let me know!"

 	Hi there,
We are holding a meeting with about 15 people on this Friday 5/2 and are hoping to book the Meridian room. We will need a projector and the room to be set up conference room style. Also, please let me know if there have been any hiccups in billing and payment as we want to make sure you are paid asap!
Thanks, Nico"
