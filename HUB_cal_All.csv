Dear Hub Oakland,

I am writing from the Art of Living Foundation, and would like to know if you would like to partner with us to celebrate the International Day of Happiness. The United Nations deemed March 20th the International Day of Happiness. See below for our plans. If we were to partner with you, we would love to have it at the HUB Impact Oakland, and invite your community. 

Happiness Gathering for International Day of Happiness

Thursday, March 20, 2014
7:00 PM to 8:30 PM

Berkeley Happiness Center
2424 Spaulding Ave, Berkeley, CA

The United Nations has named March 20th the International Day of Happiness.  What does it take for you to be happy? Come share and reflect.

The Art of Living Foundation, founder of ""The Happiness Program,"" celebrates with a Happiness Gathering. 

Breath, meditate, and celebrate. Be free, be light, now! Learn simple tools and techniques to rid the mind of stress and be Happy! 35 years ago Sri Sri Ravi Shankar started teaching people the Sudarshan Kriya- a purifying breathing technique. Since then millions around the world have learned it.  Dubbed the fastest growing spiritual movement on earth, we will be hosting our very own Happiness Program in Berkeley, April 17-21.

DOWNTOWN - Empowerment 2.0 with Tenaya,04/24/2014 09:00,04/24/2014 17:00,08:00,Lisa Chacon,"
Thursday, April 24 – Sunday April 27th
9am – 5pm
Impact Hub Oakland
2323 Broadway Blvd, Oakland CA, 94612
REGISTER HERE
Free for HUB members, $50 for non-members

Our success as a change agent is integrally linked to our capacity to hold a vision that inspires others and compels them to action. Our capacity to create and hold a vision is integrally linked to our ability to do this for ourselves. As a member of HUB, you have an opportunity to learn a transformational methodology—the Empowerment Framework—developed by two people considered the world’s foremost experts in empowerment and founders of the Empowerment Institute.

This 4 day workshop is being offered Free to HUB members and for $50 to non-members by Tenaya Asan, who is studying with David and Gail. She will deliver this tried and true workshop, which has been delivered all over the world and to women in developing nations for over three decades. For more information about the workshop, contact Tenaya tenayaasan1@gmail.com or call 510-918-5353.

By focusing on your own life, you will learn what it takes to empower yourself and others on our journey to creating a world where everyone thrives. It will help you to tune into the compelling vision that is uniquely meaningful to you and to bring it into being through a transformational methodology—the Empowerment Framework.   It honors the “being” and “doing” of human life. The result: a consciously created life that represents your deepest aspirations and fondest dreams.

You will be able to apply it to the seven areas of your life:  emotions, relationships, sexuality, your body, money, work, and spirituality. By applying it to your own life, you will learn to transfer this framework to clients and communities you work with.

In each of these seven life areas, the Empowerment Workshop teaches you how to:

Discover what’s uniquely meaningful to you.
Translate this insight into a compelling vision.
Transform the unconscious limiting beliefs that might prevent its realization.
Build clear intentions (being and/or doing) to manifest your vision.
Use the Empowerment Framework continually to keep your vision current and to identify next steps towards your vision that align with your inner guidance.
Use the Empowerment Framework with your Change Agent work.

About Empowerment Institute:

The developers of this workshop, David Gershon and Gail Straub of Empowerment Institute have empowered women in developing countries to overcome abusive and adverse situations, empowered western culture communities to reduce their carbon footprint, empowered thousands of organizations worldwide to develop and move towards a collective vision and tens of thousands of individuals to change their lives. Their first project in the early 1980’s brought a world together with The First Earth Run which succeeded in empowering the Soviet Union and the US to stand down their nuclear weapons which at the time were pointed at one another.

 	Hi there,

We are holding a meeting with about 15 people on this Friday 5/2 and are hoping to book the Meridian room. We will need a projector and the room to be set up conference room style. Also, please let me know if there have been any hiccups in billing and payment as we want to make sure you are paid asap!

Thanks, Nico",Meridian Room,Conference Room

It looks like we're going to need a projector, and ""U-shaped or classroom style or at small tables/pods"". I think that as long as we have the tables and chairs in the room, we can set it up as the trainer sees fit.

Friends don't let friends feel like noobs. Start your friend's day off with an exclusive group tour, where both hosts and members will introduce them to their new workspace. Now is the perfect time for them to ask culture questions, service-related inquiries, and meet other folks just like them. (and if they go on the tour, you won't have to help them walk-through the ""how to print' instructions). To top it off, Impact Hub Founders will be there to say hey, introduce themselves, and give them a warm welcome to Impact Hub Oakland. ",Host desk area,HUB Oakland Events

Their incredible patio with string lights and graffiti will make you want to stay all night. We won't keep you that long. :)

Event info:

Our Members-Only Exclusive Gallery Event is here again! 
Friends, when we get together, it's a *blast* and this event will be no different. 

Join us at Impact Hub Oakland Thursday, June 5th from 5:30 PM to 8:00 PM, to get an exclusive sneak peek of Omi Gallery's latest gallery exhibit ""Oakland Made"", a large-scale, collective installation of Oakland's incredible Makers. Unlike other exhibits, however, this show is leaving the confines of Omi's humble space and bursting out into our 16,000 sq foot co-working space!

If you're a Burner, Maker, and/or Art Fiend, you're going to want to be there. 

RSVP HERE: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/get-made-a-members-only-exclusive-gallery-event-tickets-11785796635

Get up close, get hands on, and see the exhibit before it opens to the public. Can't wait to have bites, brews, and art with you. Stay fresh and see you there. ",Omi gallery,HUB Oakland Events

OMI GALLERY: Monday Morning w/ Emily Haydock,08/04/2014 08:30,08/04/2014 09:30,01:00,Roshanda Cummings,"Start your week off right by taking the time to reconnect with yourself and your community, set an intention for the next seven days, and begin to put that intention in motion! After a group check-in, we'll ease into a slow flowing Vinyasa practice, building in intensity as we progress. Come get your energy flowing and integrate your mind and body to help you feel more present and empowered in your work and life. Bring a mat, stretchy clothes, and whatever's alive for you at the moment. This donation-based class is open to participants of all backgrounds and abilities. 

About the instructor: Emily Haydock first fell in love with yoga in 2001. Inspired to share the grounding, healing, and spiritual growth that the practice brought her in the following decade, she enrolled in a Vinyasa teacher training in Brooklyn in 2011. She went on to teach in studios, schools, offices, homes and parks throughout NYC while completing an advanced yoga teacher training. In 2013, she moved to the Bay Area to study Somatic Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies. She is passionate about helping others feel as expansive, at home in their bodies, and connected to others as yoga has enabled her to feel.","Impact Hub Oakland, 2323 Broadway, OMI Gallery ",HUB Oakland Events

OMI GALLERY: Monday Morning Yoga w/ Emily Haydock,08/18/2014 08:30,08/18/2014 09:30,01:00,Roshanda Cummings,"Start your week off right by taking the time to reconnect with yourself and your community, set an intention for the next seven days, and begin to put that intention in motion! After a group check-in, we'll ease into a slow flowing Vinyasa practice, building in intensity as we progress. Come get your energy flowing and integrate your mind and body to help you feel more present and empowered in your work and life. Bring a mat, stretchy clothes, and whatever's alive for you at the moment. This donation-based class is open to participants of all backgrounds and abilities. 

About the instructor: Emily Haydock first fell in love with yoga in 2001. Inspired to share the grounding, healing, and spiritual growth that the practice brought her in the following decade, she enrolled in a Vinyasa teacher training in Brooklyn in 2011. She went on to teach in studios, schools, offices, homes and parks throughout NYC while completing an advanced yoga teacher training. In 2013, she moved to the Bay Area to study Somatic Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies. She is passionate about helping others feel as expansive, at home in their bodies, and connected to others as yoga has enabled her to feel.","Impact Hub Oakland, 2323 Broadway",HUB Oakland Events

Event info: 
Our personal data has been used to spy on us, hire and fire us, and sell us stuff we don’t need. OkCupid co-founder Christian Rudder — writer of the popular blog OkTrends and Harvard mathematics graduate — has made a name for himself by mining big data to reveal the uncanny and surprising truths behind human behavior. In his new book Dataclysm, Christian strives to harness the infinite potential of the online to do more than predict the next election cycle or try to market a product. Instead, he aims to use big data to understand human nature, from our politics to our standards of beauty to our racism.

Join us for our inaugural Oakland event at the very cool Impact Hub to confront our essential selves according to Facebook, Google, Twitter and the data collecting engines of the internet age.","Impact Hub Oakland, Broadway, Oakland, CA, United States",HUB Oakland Events

6:00-6:45– Charles and Aftab (45 minute interactive dialogue on Beyond the Green Economy. The concept of the Green Economy seeks to align money with ecological values. As such it is a positive step, but it ignores deeper forms of social, cultural, and spiritual hegemony. Increasingly, it is at this deeper level that we are called to act: a transition not only in our institutions but also in our ways of thinking, knowing, and relating.)

6:45-7:30 - Responding Guests (Charles, Caroline, Konda, Ashara, as well as others) will respond and pick up on key points that arise out of the conversation between Charles and Aftab.

Event info:
Our event is to launch a new 'ART finding' app. Our mission is to bring art to the community and to ALL people. We would like to hang art from local artists in the gallery, but also plan to invite 120+ people. We hope to align this with first Friday of February 2015. Although we are not currently a non-profit, we have a very small budget. We believe our event will support the Impact Hub Oakland mission with art and music from local creatives.

All you have to do is relax in a specially designed chair, and a professional massage practitioner will take the kinks out of your back, shoulders, neck, head and arms. In as little as ten minutes, you return to your day feeling looser, refreshed and relaxed. Extra-stressed or have more time to spare? Choose up to 30 minutes or more for the ultimate drop-in relaxation break.

Join us for an interactive presentation and tasty samples to see how delicious, nutritious, simple, and inexpensive veg eating can be! We will show you why and how to get more plant-based, whole food ingredients into your daily routine (or maybe just your Meatless Mondays) and debunk some myths along the way. Get practical tips, get inspired, and get ready to make a difference with every meal! 

Presented by Michelle Dwyer, Health Coach and Nutrition Consultant, and Lora Silver, Integrative Nutrition Health Coach. A short introduction to Meatless Monday will be presented by Kristie Middleton of The Humane Society of the United States. This event is part of Oakland Veg Week, an annual city-wide vegetarian pledge week that highlights the benefits of vegetarian eating and features workshops, film screenings, panel discussions, and the first annual Oakland Veg Fest.
