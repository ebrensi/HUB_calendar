# HUB_calendar
This repository contains the script for parsing room booking info from the Oakland Impact Hub's Events calendar, and calculating some values from the data.   First we parse the raw text from Google calendar fields and classify it by room and renter, income generated, etc.

Note this project is mostly replaced by the HUB invoice analysis project.
